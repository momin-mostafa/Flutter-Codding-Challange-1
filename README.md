## Step 1: 
To complete step 1. I need a login page. So that i can implement firebase auth. for that purpose i have created a folder called firebase auth services which should contain all the backend code needed for firebase auth with email and password.
and a screens folder to contain all the UI related code. 

To separate back-end and font-end I created two folders called CORE for "backend logic" and SCREENS for UI part. and data to contain all the models that would be needed for the project.

using getx for state management because its good for state management and also for other task like showing a snackbar in login page.
