flutter Coding challenge


## Step 1: 
To complete step 1. I need a login page. So that i can implement firebase auth. for that purpose i have created a folder called firebase auth services which should contain all the backend code needed for firebase auth with email and password.
and a screens folder to contain all the UI related code. 

To separate back-end and font-end I created two folders called CORE for "backend logic" and SCREENS for UI part. and data to contain all the models that would be 
needed for the project.

using getx for state management because its good for state management and also for other task like showing a snackbar in login page.

## Step 2:
To complete step 2. I need to create a gridview.builder since I dont know exact ammount of products. and functions to fetch and put data in firebase storage. but
the problem I am facing is I never used storage & image picker & gridview builder together, So and maximum tutorials i can find are not null safe. and many of the 
functions they used in the tutorials are now deprecated and I cant use the proper one.
